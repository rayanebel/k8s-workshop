# Lab04: CREATE YOUR OWN CONTAINER IMAGE

## Objective

Learn how to create your own container image from a real application developed in Golang.

## Instructions

- Letâ€™s build a small application (live coding if time).

The source code will be available just after. The purpose of this is to make you a demo on how to build an image for a real application. You can later train yourself with a easier example.

- Create the Dockerfile for the application.
- Create the container image from the Dockerfile.
- Create a container with the image built in the previous step.
- Update the codebase and build a newest version of the image.
- Recreate the container with the newest image.
